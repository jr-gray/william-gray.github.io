            I am a Data Analyst with experience using SQL, machine learning, and visualization to find useful insights in data. I worked for over three years at Encore Capital Group, where I worked with consumer credit data and used statistical models to predict consumer/portfolio performance. I left the company a few months ago to focus on improving my technical skills, and now I'm looking to jump back into a full time role.
